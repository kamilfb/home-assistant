# Home Assistant
This repository covers my Home Assistant setup - primarily the configuration files.

# Key componenets
This setup centres around energy monitoring (particularly our solar PV setup) and automation of energy sinks.

Overall, the following devices are used:

* Solax X1 Hybrid G4 solar PV inverter
* 6.2kWh battery storage (integrated into the inverter)
* Sonoff Powr3 controlled hot water 3kW immersion heater for 210L tank
* Kasa smart socket for controlling an 2kW electric heater
* Kasa smart socket for delaying dishwasher runs (plus usage monitoring)

Most of the setup is described here: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/solax-x1-hybrid-g4-local-cloud-api/506172

Any ideas for improvement are highly appreciated!
